  Example
  =======

     data:
       - title: Planetary Locations Dataset
         description: >-
           CSV formatted files containing the coordinates of planets in Earth's
           solar system
         source: Institute for Evil Research
         url: "http://www.ier.org/datasets/planets.html"
         
         files:
           - description: CSV file containing the coordinates of Mars
             path: /root/data/mars/coordinates.csv
             metadata:
               - description: Average distance from Earth (million miles)
                 data: 140
               - description: Planetary order relative to the Sun
                 data: 4
                 
           - description: CSV file containing the coordinates of Jupiter
             path: /root/data/jupiter/coordinates.csv
             metadata:
               - description: Average distance from Earth (million miles)
                 data: 483
               - description: Planetary order relative to the Sun
                 data: 5
     

  Best practices
  ==============

   + Include 2-3 metadata statistics about each file to show differences

   + Include the file format in the file description

   + Use URLs from the source's website
