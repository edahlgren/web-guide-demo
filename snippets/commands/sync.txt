  Rsync from localhost to the demo


  Quick reference
  ===============

   Access a copy of /root/src from a shared directory outside the demo

     $ demo share /root/src
     
   Sync changes you made in a shared directory so they appear in /root/src in the
   demo

     $ demo sync /root/src
     
   Access an exact copy of /root/src from a shared directory, deleting files in the
   shared directory if necessary

     $ demo share /root/src --completely
     
   Sync changes to /root/src completely, deleting files under /root/src in the demo
   if necessary

     $ demo sync /root/src --completely
     

  Summary
  =======

   When you run 'demo shell' to enter a demo, you select a shared directory whose
   contents will show up in the demo under /shared. When you change the contents of
   your shared directory, those changes will also appear in /shared, and vice
   versa.

   'demo share' uses rsync to efficiently copy a directory in the demo (e.g.
   /root/src) to the same directory in /shared (e.g. /shared/root/src). Use this
   command to access demo files from your shared directory outside the demo,
   allowing you to view and change the demo files using your favorite editors and
   tools.

   'demo sync' uses rsync to efficiently copy a directory in /shared (e.g.
   /shared/root/src) back to the same directory in the demo (e.g. /root/src). Use
   this command to pull changes you made in your shared directory back into the
   demo.


  Ways to share and sync
  ======================

   Share and sync or your current directory

     $ demo share
     $ demo sync
     
   Share and sync a specific directory

     $ demo share /dir
     $ demo sync /dir
     
   Share and sync a directory completely, allowing files to be deleted (use
   cautiously)

     $ demo share /dir --completely
     $ demo sync /dir --completely
     
   Manually execute the rsync commands produced by

     $ demo share /dir --dryrun
     $ demo sync /dir --dryrun
     
   Show rsync output, like files copied

     $ demo share /dir --verbose
     $ demo sync /dir --verbose
     

  Example
  =======

   Share a repository of code in /root/src

     $ demo share /root/src/repo
     
   Edit the files in your shared directory outside of the demo. Then pull in the
   changes

     $ demo sync /root/src/repo
     
   Rebuild and run the default configuration with your changes

     $ demo build && demo run
     

  Why this workflow
  =================

   The files inside the demo are likely owned by a different user (e.g. root) than
   the files outside the demo (e.g. your user ID). When you run 'demo share', files
   are not only efficiently copied, they are also changed so you own them and
   therefore can modify them outside of the demo. When you run 'demo sync', file
   ownership is changed to your user in the demo so you can also easily access them
   in the demo again.

   Some tools do this automatically, like the unison tool and most network
   filesystems. We use rsync because:

   + No setup required

   + You choose when to sync, as needed

   + It's stable and easy to understand (e.g. copy file diffs)


   If you want to keep some directories in the demo automatically in sync with your
   shared directory, you can write a small script that executes 'demo share' and
   'demo sync' in a loop. A script isn't provided because you may have specific
   needs and preferences for handling syncing errors that happen in the background.
